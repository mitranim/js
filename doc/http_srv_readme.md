## Overview

{{codeHead}} provides miscellaneous tools useful for HTTP servers. It uses only standard web APIs which work in all environments. For environment-specific tools, see the following modules, which also re-export everything from this module:
* {{featLink http_bun}}: tools for Bun servers.
* {{featLink http_deno}}: tools for Deno servers.

Also see {{featLink http}} for routing and cookies, and {{featLink http_live}} for live-reload tools for development.
