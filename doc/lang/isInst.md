Signature: `(val, Cls) => bool`.

Same as `instanceof` but _does not_ implicitly convert the operand to an object. True only if the operand is already an instance of the given class. Also unlike `instanceof`, this is always false for functions, avoiding the insanity of `fun instanceof Function` being true.
